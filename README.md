Hey there 👋🏻 

My name's Tobias and I'm a Software Engineer from Germany with a passion for GraphQL.<br/>
Currently I'm working as a GraphQL Engineer on Switzerland's largest E-Commerce [galaxus.ch](https://galaxus.ch).<br/>
I enjoy making developer's lives easier, so you'll catch me contributing improvements in various OSS projects.<br/>
Oh, and could you tell that I love cats? 🐈
