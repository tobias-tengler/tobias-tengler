Hey there 👋🏻 

My name's Tobi and I'm a Software Engineer from Germany with a passion for GraphQL.<br/>
Currently I'm working at Switzerland's largest E-Commerce [galaxus.ch](https://galaxus.ch), supporting 10+ engineering teams in their GraphQL endeavours.<br/>

I enjoy making developer's lives easier, so you'll catch me contributing improvements to various OSS projects.
